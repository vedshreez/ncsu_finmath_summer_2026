## 1. Course Overview

This ten-week summer research program prepares students in the North
Carolina State University Financial Mathematics graduate program to
design, implement, and evaluate optimal market making strategies for
cryptocurrency options. The program is organized around the
**Avellaneda–Stoikov framework**, the foundational stochastic-control
approach to optimal liquidity provision. The central pedagogical question
is how to extend Avellaneda–Stoikov, which was originally formulated for
a single linear instrument, to non-linear derivatives whose inventory
risk is multi-dimensional in the Greeks. A dedicated advanced week treats
extensions of Avellaneda–Stoikov to the multi-asset, adverse-selection,
discrete-inventory, signal-driven, and robust settings.

Week 1 was an **introduction week**, delivered last week: it covered the
program goals, the development environment, the Coincall datasets, and
the logistics described in Sections 1.5–1.7. The nine technical weeks
that follow (Weeks 2–10) are the substance of this syllabus.

The program is mentored by Dendi Suhubdy and includes two guest sessions
from Fenni Kang, Chief Strategy Officer at Coincall, on **taker
strategies** (Week 9) and on the **corporate usage of options and
structured products** (Week 10). Students will work with live and
historical Coincall data throughout the program and will produce a
research-grade final report and code repository suitable for further
academic or industry use.

### 1.1 Implementation Languages

The program uses a deliberate two-language split, and students should
understand the rationale:

- **Problem sets are written in Python**, using **PyTorch** as the
  numerical engine. PyTorch is chosen so that *differentiation is handled
  implicitly by autograd*: students compute option Greeks, calibrate
  surfaces, and fit intensities by writing the forward computation only
  and letting `.backward()` produce the sensitivities. We deliberately do
  **not** ask students to hand-derive adjoint algorithmic differentiation;
  the goal is correct, readable research code, not AD plumbing.

- **Fast-computation methods are written in C++.** The latency-critical
  numerical kernels — characteristic-function pricers, implied-volatility
  inversion, and full-surface revaluation — are implemented in C++ for
  speed, then exposed to Python through a **`pybind11`** binding so that
  the same Python research code can call them. Week 7 teaches `pybind11`
  explicitly: how to write a binding module, build it with CMake, manage
  the GIL, and pass NumPy/PyTorch tensors across the boundary without
  copying.

The result is a realistic hybrid that mirrors industry practice: Python
for research and orchestration, C++ for the hot path, and a clean binder
between them.

### 1.2 Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this program, students will be able to:

1. Formulate a market making problem as a continuous-time stochastic
   optimal control problem and understand the associated
   Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation.
2. Solve the HJB system for the Avellaneda–Stoikov model in closed form
   and implement the resulting quoting policy as a Python/PyTorch engine
   validated against the analytical solution.
3. Calibrate parametric volatility surfaces (SVI, SABR) to live
   cryptocurrency options data in PyTorch and assess their stability
   across time.
4. Implement latency-critical pricing, implied-volatility, and Greek
   routines in C++ and call them from Python through a `pybind11` binding.
5. Extend the Avellaneda–Stoikov framework to a multi-Greek inventory
   penalty following El Aoud and Abergel, and reduce the resulting HJB
   system to a numerically tractable form.
6. Integrate a dynamic hedging policy with the quoting engine and analyze
   the resulting P&L attribution.
7. Build and validate an event-driven backtest that consumes real
   Coincall order-book data and produces interpretable P&L, risk, and
   Greek-exposure diagnostics.
8. Situate the maker (market-making) perspective against **taker
   strategies**, and understand how options are used by corporates through
   **structured products** (collars, accumulators/decumulators, coupon
   products).
9. Implement at least one advanced extension of Avellaneda–Stoikov and
   communicate the results in writing and orally at a level suitable for
   industry quantitative-research interviews.

### 1.3 Prerequisites

Students are expected to have completed or be concurrently enrolled in
graduate coursework covering: stochastic calculus (Itô integration, Itô's
lemma, Girsanov's theorem), continuous-time stochastic processes
(Brownian motion, Poisson processes, jump-diffusions),
Black–Scholes–Merton option pricing, partial differential equations at
the level of Evans, and probability theory at the level of Durrett.

Programming maturity in **Python** is required, including comfort with
NumPy and the basics of **PyTorch** (tensors, autograd). Familiarity with
**modern C++ (C++17)** and **CMake** is advantageous for the
fast-computation week but is taught from a working scaffold; no prior
`pybind11` experience is assumed.

### 1.4 Structure

The program runs for ten weeks. Week 1 was the introduction week
(delivered last week). Each of the nine technical weeks (Weeks 2–10)
comprises two ninety-minute lectures, one ninety-minute recitation, and
approximately fifteen hours of independent reading, programming, and
benchmarking. **Weeks 5, 7, and 9 are milestone weeks** at which students
deliver a working software component built on the preceding weeks'
material. The final week (Week 10) surveys advanced Avellaneda–Stoikov
extensions and is devoted to a chosen extension topic and the preparation
and presentation of a research-grade final report.

The schedule is built around the Avellaneda–Stoikov framework as the
unifying worked example: it is introduced in Week 3, placed within the
general continuous-time control template in Week 4, implemented as a
production engine in Week 5, and extended to a multi-Greek options setting
in Week 8. Extensions of Avellaneda–Stoikov are consolidated into the
dedicated advanced week (Week 10) rather than being interleaved
throughout.

### 1.5 Assessment

Final grades are determined as follows. Weekly problem sets account for
thirty percent of the grade. The three milestone deliverables in Weeks 5,
7, and 9 jointly account for thirty percent. The final report and
presentation account for thirty percent. Active participation in lecture,
recitation, and code review accounts for the remaining ten percent.

The weekly problem sets are distributed as a separate **Problem Sets**
booklet; fully worked solutions are distributed (to graders, and to
students after each deadline) as a separate **Solutions** booklet.

### 1.6 Mentorship Model

Because the industry mentor contributes on a volunteer basis alongside a
full-time role, mentorship is primarily **asynchronous** and carries **no
fixed weekly time commitment**. The mentor is reachable by **email and
Telegram**, and aims to respond within a few business days. This channel
is intended for clarification of difficult material, code review of
milestone deliverables, and discussion of research directions for the
final week; students should send specific, well-prepared questions
(including a minimal reproducible code snippet where relevant).

When a question genuinely needs a live conversation, **bespoke one-on-one
sessions are arranged ad hoc**, subject to the mentor's availability,
rather than on a standing weekly schedule. Day-to-day support — recitation,
office hours, and first-pass grading — is provided by the program tutors,
who escalate to the mentor as needed.

### 1.7 Guest Practitioner Sessions

Fenni Kang (Chief Strategy Officer, Coincall) contributes two guest
sessions, integrated as additional lectures within the regular schedule:

- **Week 9 — Taker Strategies.** A practitioner's view of liquidity
  *consumption*: when and why takers cross the spread, the signals that
  drive aggressive flow, and how taker behaviour shapes the order flow
  that the market maker must price.
- **Week 10 — Corporate Usage of Options and Structured Products.** How
  corporates and treasuries use options: collars to fix a price band,
  accumulators and decumulators for staged accumulation/liquidation, and
  coupon (yield-enhancement) products. The session connects the
  market-maker's book to the structured-product flow that generates it.

## 2. Program Milestones at a Glance

The program is organized around three milestone deliverables. Each
milestone integrates the material from the preceding weeks and produces a
software artifact that is incorporated into the final research
repository.

| Week | Title | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Linear-asset Avellaneda–Stoikov engine | Python/PyTorch implementation of the Avellaneda–Stoikov model on a single linear asset, validated against simulated dynamics and benchmarked on one month of Coincall BTC-PERP order-book data. |
| 7 | Fast pricing and Greeks library | C++ pricing/implied-vol/Greeks library for European options under Black–Scholes and Heston dynamics, exposed to Python via `pybind11`, with PyTorch reference Greeks. Latency target: full Coincall BTC surface revaluation in under 5 milliseconds. |
| 9 | Full options market-making backtest | Event-driven backtest of the multi-Greek market-making engine on three months of Coincall BTC and ETH options data, with full P&L attribution, risk metrics, and Greek-exposure time series. |

## 3. Week-by-Week Schedule

Each of the following sections gives the learning objectives, lecture
outlines, recitation activity, required reading, and (where applicable)
milestone deliverable for one week of the program. Detailed problem-set
questions live in the separate Problem Sets booklet; each week below lists
the problem set's scope and its implementation language.

---

### Week 1 — Introduction (Delivered)

*Theme: orientation, environment, and data. This week was delivered last
week and is recorded here for completeness.*

Week 1 introduced the program's goals and arc, the maker-versus-taker
framing, and the development environment. Students set up the Python +
PyTorch toolchain, a C++17 toolchain with CMake, and a working `pybind11`
"hello world" binding; received credentials to the Coincall data store;
and signed the data-use agreement. There was no graded problem set for
Week 1.

---

### Week 2 — Foundations of Market Microstructure

*Theme: from limit order books to the economic role of the market maker.*

**Learning Objectives**

- Reconstruct a limit order book from raw exchange feeds and compute
  standard liquidity metrics.
- Articulate the three classical components of the bid-ask spread and
  identify them in real data.
- Explain the role of the market maker as a continuously quoting
  liquidity provider, and contrast it with directional and taker
  trading.

**Lecture 1 — Limit Order Book Mechanics.** Order types (market, limit,
IOC, post-only, hidden); price-time priority and the matching algorithm;
L1/L2/L3 order-book views; tick size and lot size; and the Coincall
exchange architecture (contract specifications, fee structure, market
maker tiers).

**Lecture 2 — Spread Decomposition and the Role of the Market Maker.**
The bid-ask spread decomposed into adverse selection, inventory, and
order-processing components, via the classical models of Roll (1984),
Glosten–Milgrom (1985), and Kyle (1985); realized spread, effective
spread, and price impact; why crypto microstructure differs from
equities.

**Recitation.** Reconstruct the order book from a Coincall tick-level
recording in Python: replay one hour of BTC-PERP events and produce a
time series of mid-prices, spreads, and book depth. Output: a Python class
that maintains live order-book state from raw events.

reduction to ODEs in θ; the reservation price r = S − qγσ²(T−t); and the
optimal half-spread and its decomposition into risk-aversion and
order-flow components.

**Recitation.** Walk through the derivation together, then implement the
closed-form quotes in PyTorch and visualize the reservation price and
spread as functions of inventory.

**Required Reading.** Avellaneda and Stoikov (2008); Cartea, Jaikumar, and

### Week 7 — Fast Computation of Prices, Greeks, Implied Volatility, and Surfaces

*Theme: the latency budget of an options market maker, and the C++
numerical methods that meet it. **Milestone 2.***

**Learning Objectives**

- Implement and benchmark characteristic-function pricing methods
  (Carr–Madan FFT and Fang–Oosterlee COS) in C++.
- Implement robust, fast implied-volatility inversion and full-surface
  revaluation in C++.
- Expose the C++ kernels to Python with `pybind11`, and validate Greeks
  against PyTorch autograd.

**Lecture 1 — Characteristic-Function Pricing and Implied Volatility in
C++.** The characteristic function under Black–Scholes and Heston; the
Carr–Madan FFT method; the Fang–Oosterlee COS method and its truncation
interval; robust implied-vol inversion (Jäckel-style rational starts plus
a safeguarded Newton/Halley step); vectorizing a whole surface.

**Lecture 2 — Binding C++ to Python with `pybind11`.** This is the
binder lecture. How a `pybind11` module is structured and built with
CMake; passing NumPy/PyTorch tensors across the boundary without copying
(buffer protocol, `py::array_t`); releasing the GIL around the C++ hot
loop; and how to keep a single source of truth for Greeks by validating
the C++ results against PyTorch autograd. We rely on PyTorch for
*reference* Greeks rather than hand-rolling adjoint AD in C++ — autograd
is the oracle, C++ is the speed.

**Recitation.** Profile a naive Python pricer, move the kernel to C++,
bind it with `pybind11`, and re-benchmark — targeting at least an order of
magnitude speedup and a sub-5ms full-surface revaluation.

**Required Reading.** Carr and Madan (1999); Fang and Oosterlee (2008);
Jäckel (2015), *Let's Be Rational*; the `pybind11` documentation

**Problem Set 7 (C++ with `pybind11`, called from Python).** Constitutes
Milestone 2: a C++ COS/Carr–Madan pricer, a robust C++ implied-vol solver,
a vectorized surface revaluation, all bound to Python via `pybind11`, with
Greeks validated against PyTorch autograd and latency reported as a
distribution. See the Problem Sets booklet.

> **Milestone Deliverable — Milestone 2: Fast Pricing and Greeks
> Library.** A C++ library that prices European options under
> Black–Scholes and Heston via characteristic-function methods, inverts
> implied volatility robustly, computes the full Greek vector, and
> revalues the entire calibrated Coincall surface within a strict latency
> budget — all exposed to Python through a `pybind11` module. Greeks are
> validated against an independent PyTorch-autograd reference.
>
> *Datasets:* `coincall_btc_options_chain_snapshots_2025Q4.parquet`,
> `coincall_calibrated_svi_surfaces_2025Q4.parquet`,

and funding-rate considerations on Coincall.

**Recitation.** Multi-Greek HJB walk-through, then a PyTorch hedged-book
simulation comparing hedge policies and P&L distributions.

**Required Reading.** El Aoud and Abergel (2015); Taleb (1997), selected
chapters; Cartea, Jaikumar, and Penalva (2015), Ch. 11.

### Week 9 — Backtesting, Risk Analysis, and Taker Strategies

*Theme: assembling the full system and validating it on historical data,
with a practitioner's view of taker flow. **Milestone 3.***

**Learning Objectives**

state tracking (cash, inventory by contract, aggregated Greeks, hedge
position); pitfalls (look-ahead bias, unrealistic fills, expiry handling);
Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar, drawdown, and P&L attribution; the deflated Sharpe
ratio and block-bootstrap confidence intervals.

**Lecture 2 (Guest — Fenni Kang, Coincall) — Taker Strategies.** A
practitioner's view of liquidity consumption: when and why takers cross
the spread; the signals that drive aggressive flow (momentum, liquidation
cascades, news); execution styles (sweep, TWAP/VWAP, iceberg-taking); and
what taker behaviour implies for the toxicity of the order flow a market
maker faces.

**Recitation.** Code review of the full backtest; each student presents
one regime and walks through the P&L attribution.

### Week 10 — Advanced Avellaneda–Stoikov, Structured Products, and Final Presentations

*Theme: advanced extensions of Avellaneda–Stoikov, the corporate
structured-products view, one chosen extension, and the communication of
results.*

**Learning Objectives**

- Survey advanced extensions of Avellaneda–Stoikov (multi-asset, adverse
  selection, discrete inventory, signal-driven, robust) and implement one.
- Understand how corporates use options through structured products.
- Write and present a research-grade report.

**Lecture 1 — Advanced Avellaneda–Stoikov Extensions.** Multi-asset
market making across BTC and ETH options under a correlated covariance
matrix; adverse-selection-aware quoting and skew trading from calibrated
SVI parameters; signal-driven quoting (machine-learned order-flow
prediction); discrete-inventory formulations; and robust optimization with
a worst-case inventory penalty over a confidence set. Students choose one
extension by end of day.

**Lecture 2 (Guest — Fenni Kang, Coincall) — Corporate Usage of Options
and Structured Products.** How corporates and treasuries use options:
**collars** to fix a price band on a holding; **accumulators /
decumulators** for staged accumulation or liquidation; and **coupon /
yield-enhancement products**. The session links these structured-product
flows to the market-maker's book — how a desk warehouses and hedges the
resulting Greek exposure — and closes with guidance on research-report
structure and the oral presentation.

**Recitation.** Final dry-run presentations to the cohort, with feedback
focused on the questions an industry audience would ask.

**Required Reading.** Guéant (2016), the chapter most relevant to the
chosen extension; El Aoud and Abergel (2015) (re-read with the extension
in mind); one additional paper relevant to the chosen extension; for the
guest session, a short structured-products primer distributed in advance.

**Problem Set 10 (Python/PyTorch).** A one-page extension proposal; a
PyTorch implementation of the chosen advanced Avellaneda–Stoikov extension
on top of the milestone infrastructure; a quantitative comparison against
the Week 9 baseline; the final report (≤ 30 pages); and the final
twenty-minute presentation. See the Problem Sets booklet.

## Appendix A. Coincall Dataset Catalog

All datasets are delivered as Parquet files on a secure object store under
a non-disclosure agreement. The naming convention is
`coincall_{instrument}_{data_type}_{period}.parquet`.

- **Order book data** — L2 snapshots (top ten levels per side), at 1-second
  resolution for options and 100 ms for perpetual futures, each row
  carrying bid/ask prices and sizes per level, a strictly increasing
  sequence number, and an exchange timestamp. L2 is sufficient for both
  intensity calibration and the simulation environment.
- **Trade data** — the full trade tape (contract id, price, size, aggressor
  side, trade id); options trades additionally carry the mark implied
  volatility at trade time, used for surface calibration in Week 6 and the
  fill simulator in Week 9.
- **Surface data** — calibrated SVI parameters at five-minute frequency,
  used as a baseline for the fast revaluation pipeline in Week 7.
- **Auxiliary data** — hourly perpetual-futures funding rates (for hedging
  cost accounting in Week 9) and a static snapshot of contract
  specifications.

Students receive credentials to a secure S3-compatible endpoint at the
start of the program. Data may be downloaded locally for analysis but may
not be redistributed. Coincall retains the right to update the dataset
catalog during the program with at least one week of notice.
