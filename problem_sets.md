# Problem Sets

**Optimal Market Making for Cryptocurrency Options**

*The Avellaneda–Stoikov Framework and its Extension to Options*

North Carolina State University — Summer 2026

---

## Instructions

These are the weekly programming assignments for Weeks 2–10 (Week 1 was
the introduction week and had no graded set).

- **Problem sets are written in Python**, using **PyTorch** as the
  numerical engine. Use PyTorch autograd for all derivatives (Greeks,
  Jacobians, gradients) — you are **not** asked to hand-derive or
  hand-code algorithmic differentiation.
- **Week 7 is the exception**: it is written in **C++** and called from
  Python through a **`pybind11`** binding. A `CMakeLists.txt` scaffold is
  provided.
- Each problem set ships with a starter repository: data loaders, a test
  harness (`pytest`), and (Week 7) the `pybind11`/CMake scaffold.
- Emit numerical results as CSV and figures as PNG for inclusion in your
  write-up. Where a problem asks for a comment, print it from your code as
  a short summary of the actual numbers.
- Submissions are due Sunday 23:59 Eastern. Set seeds for reproducibility.

Worked solutions are distributed separately in the **Solutions** booklet
after each deadline.

## Problem Set 2 — Foundations of Market Microstructure *(Python)*

1. **Order-book reconstruction.** Implement a Python class `L2Book` that
   consumes a stream of events (`new`, `cancel`, `modify`, `trade`) and
   maintains the L2 state in a price-keyed structure (e.g. two
   `SortedDict`s). Apply it to one hour of Coincall BTC-PERP data and emit
   a CSV of mid-price and quoted spread over time. Remember to remove
   price levels that become empty after a cancel.
2. **Roll estimator.** Compute the Roll effective-spread estimator
   `2*sqrt(-cov(Deltap_t, Deltap_{t-1}))` on the same sample and compare it to the
   directly observed bid-ask spread. Print both and their discrepancy.
3. **Glosten–Milgrom quote-setter.** Implement the rational quote-setter
   as a PyTorch belief update: given an informed-trade probability and a
   prior over the asset value, compute bid and ask from the Bayesian
   posterior after a buy or a sell. Unit-test against a hand-computed
   one-trade sequence.
4. **Glosten–Milgrom simulation.** Build a Monte Carlo simulator reusing
   problem 3 and emit a CSV of the public belief converging to the true
   value, averaged over many runs.
5. **Toxicity.** Compute realized spread and price impact over a 5-minute
   decomposition window on one hour of Coincall data; print a summary
   relating the numbers to order-flow toxicity.

## Problem Set 3 — The Avellaneda–Stoikov Model *(Python/PyTorch)*

1. **Reduced ODE solver.** Implement a PyTorch backward integrator for the
   reduced system in `theta(t, q)` arising from the ansatz
   `V = -exp(-gamma(x+qS))*theta(t,q)`. Emit `theta` on a `(t, q)` grid.
2. **Closed-form quotes.** Implement the asymptotic reservation price
   `r = S - qgammasigma^2(T-t)` and half-spread
   `delta = (1/gamma)*ln(1+gamma/kappa) + (gammasigma^2/2)(T-t)` as a reusable function, and
   `pytest` it against the solver from problem 1 where they should agree.
3. **Quote engine + simulation.** Simulate one trading day with
   `sigma = 2 USD/sqrts`, `kappa = 1.5`, `A = 140`. Emit the P&L distribution of the
   optimal policy alongside a symmetric, inventory-ignoring baseline.
4. **γ sensitivity.** Sweep `gamma` over three orders of magnitude and emit a
   CSV of inventory variance and Sharpe vs. `gamma`; identify in code the most
   effective regime.
5. **Price impact.** Extend the simulator so the mid reacts linearly to
   your own fills; run three impact levels and report how each degrades the
   optimal policy's P&L (independence-assumption violation).

## Problem Set 4 — Stochastic Optimal Control *(Python/PyTorch)*

1. **Merton CRRA.** Solve the Merton problem under CRRA by discretizing the
   HJB (value iteration or backward ODE); confirm numerically the optimal
   portfolio *share* is constant in wealth.
2. **Merton CARA.** Repeat under CARA; confirm the optimal *dollar amount*
   is constant in wealth; emit a side-by-side CSV against problem 1.
3. **Almgren–Chriss.** Solve continuous-time optimal execution under
   quadratic transient impact; verify it matches the discrete-time result
   in the appropriate limit.
4. **HJB-residual verification.** Write a harness that evaluates the HJB
   residual for the Avellaneda–Stoikov value function (use autograd for the
   derivatives). Show the residual is ~machine zero for the true solution,
   then perturb it and show the residual diverges.
5. **Obstacle problem.** Solve the obstacle problem (projected SOR for the
   variational inequality) and compare to the unconstrained classical
   solution, demonstrating where a viscosity treatment is required.

## Problem Set 5 — Avellaneda–Stoikov Engine *(Python/PyTorch — Milestone 1)*

1. **Vectorized quote path.** Implement the quote computation vectorized
   over the inventory grid in PyTorch; benchmark it and report the latency
   distribution (mean, median, p95, p99).
2. **Intensity calibration.** Calibrate `Lambda^+, Lambda^-` from one week of Coincall
   fill data by maximum likelihood (minimize the negative log-likelihood
   with `torch.optim`); report fitted `A`, `kappa`, and a χ² goodness-of-fit.
3. **Paper reproduction.** Reproduce the inventory/P&L behaviour of
   Avellaneda–Stoikov (2008) on simulated data; emit the figures as CSV;
   print a summary of any discrepancies.
4. **One-month backtest.** Build the event-driven harness (replay, fill
   simulator, P&L attribution) and run a one-month BTC-PERP backtest;
   report mean/vol of P&L, Sharpe, max drawdown, mean and std of inventory,
   vs. a symmetric baseline.
5. **Tests and reproducibility.** Provide a `pytest` suite over the quote
   computation and cash/inventory bookkeeping; demonstrate
   reproducible backtests under a fixed seed.

*Deliverable: Milestone 1 (see syllabus §2 for acceptance criteria).*

## Problem Set 6 — Volatility Surface and Calibration *(Python/PyTorch)*

1. **BS Greeks via autograd.** Implement Black–Scholes pricing in PyTorch
   and obtain delta, gamma, vega, theta, vanna, volga from autograd. Verify
   vanna/volga against finite differences; report the max relative error
   across moneyness/maturity.
2. **SVI + arbitrage checks.** Implement raw SVI and the Gatheral–Jacquier
   arbitrage-free constraint checks; apply to a deliberately broken
   parameterization and have the code report which constraints fail.
3. **SVI calibration.** Fit SVI to one Coincall BTC chain snapshot
   (`torch.optim`, autograd Jacobians); report parameters, per-strike
   residuals, and RMS error in vol units.
4. **SABR calibration.** Fit SABR to the same snapshot; emit a quantitative
   comparison against SVI and a printed note on strengths/weaknesses for
   crypto.
5. **Stability study.** Run daily SVI calibration over one month; emit the
   parameter time series; implement a smoothing scheme (seed each day from
   the previous fit) and report its effect.

## Problem Set 7 — Fast Computation *(C++ with `pybind11`, called from Python — Milestone 2)*

A `CMakeLists.txt` and `pybind11` scaffold are provided. Build the module
(`cmake -B build && cmake --build build`) and import it from Python as
`fastmm`.

1. **COS / Carr–Madan pricer (C++).** Implement the Fang–Oosterlee COS
   pricer and the Carr–Madan FFT pricer for Heston European calls in C++
   (use the provided FFT dependency). Bind both to Python. Verify against a
   PyTorch Monte Carlo benchmark and report COS convergence vs. `N`.
2. **Robust implied volatility (C++).** Implement an implied-vol inversion
   with a rational initial guess and a safeguarded Newton/Halley step;
   bind it. Show convergence across the surface, including deep wings and
   short expiries.
3. **Greeks, validated by autograd.** Expose prices from C++ and compute
   the Greek vector. Validate every Greek against a **PyTorch-autograd**
   reference implementation of the same pricer; report max relative error.
   (Do **not** hand-code adjoint AD in C++ — autograd is the reference.)
4. **Vectorized surface revaluation (C++).** Revalue the full Coincall BTC
   surface (300–500 contracts) with the Greek vector; release the GIL
   around the C++ loop; report per-option latency (mean, median, p95, p99)
   and the full-surface time (target < 5 ms).
5. **The binder, explained.** In a short `BINDING.md`, explain your
   `pybind11` module to a student new to it: how tensors cross the boundary
   without copying (buffer protocol / `py::array_t`), why and where you
   release the GIL, and how the CMake build finds Python and `pybind11`.

*Deliverable: Milestone 2 (see syllabus §2 for acceptance criteria).*

## Problem Set 8 — Options Market Making and Hedging *(Python/PyTorch)*

1. **Multi-Greek inventory.** Implement inventory aggregation and the
   inventory dynamics under fills with a vector `q  in  R^k`; unit-test the
   jump structure a fill induces.
2. **El Aoud–Abergel solver.** Solve the reduced multi-Greek problem under
   a quadratic penalty in PyTorch; verify in code it collapses to the
   Avellaneda–Stoikov quotes when one Greek and one option are tracked.
3. **Penalty-matrix calibration.** Calibrate the quadratic penalty matrix
   from the empirical covariance of delta/gamma/vega over one week of
   Coincall data; emit the matrix with each entry justified by the data.
4. **Gamma–theta–variance identity.** Simulate a continuously
   delta-hedged short call (autograd for the hedge ratio) and verify
   numerically the P&L equals `integral  0.5*Gamma*(realized - implied variance)`.
5. **Threshold hedger + engine.** Implement a delta-hedger triggering when
   `|Delta| > 0.1 BTC`, integrate it with the Week-5 engine on one week of
   data, and report hedging cost, risk reduction, and the quoting/hedging
   interaction.

## Problem Set 9 — Backtesting, Risk, and Taker Flow *(Python/PyTorch — Milestone 3)*

1. **Event-driven backtest.** Implement the harness with deterministic
   replay; validate by running an identical config twice for bitwise
   results.
2. **Fill simulator.** Model fill probability as a function of quote
   distance and opposite-side depth; calibrate on a training month and
   validate on a disjoint holdout.
3. **Full backtest.** Run the multi-Greek engine on Coincall BTC options;
   report mean/std daily P&L, Sharpe (with block-bootstrap CI), max
   drawdown, and aggregated-Greek time series.
4. **P&L attribution.** Decompose daily P&L into spread, inventory, gamma,
   and hedging; emit a CSV for a stacked-area plot; assert the streams sum
   to total P&L.
5. **Drawdown forensic + taker analysis.** Identify the worst-drawdown day,
   report the environment, the positions that drove the loss, and a
   counterfactual. Using the guest lecture, characterize the taker flow on
   that day and how it affected your fills.

*Deliverable: Milestone 3 (see syllabus §2 for acceptance criteria).*

## Problem Set 10 — Advanced Extension and Final Report *(Python/PyTorch)*

1. **Proposal.** Submit a one-page proposal (problem, method, expected
   results, risks) for your chosen advanced Avellaneda–Stoikov extension by
   end of day one.
2. **Implementation.** Implement the extension in PyTorch on top of the
   milestone infrastructure (multi-asset, adverse-selection, signal-driven,
   discrete-inventory, or robust).
3. **Evaluation.** Quantify the improvement (or not) over the Week-9
   baseline using the same risk and P&L metrics, over the same window.
4. **Final report.** ≤ 30 pages, following the lecture's structure,
   incorporating all milestone work.
5. **Final presentation.** Twenty minutes to the cohort and invited
   industry guests.
